          Playing the piano and violin: I enjoy playing the piano and violin, as these
          instruments foster intelligence development, creative thinking, and relaxation.
          Playing music enhances memory, concentration, and dexterity while reducing
          stress and creating a joyful atmosphere. Practicing also nurtures perseverance
          and discipline, while boosting self-confidence in social situations.

          I love drawing since it is a wonderful way to develop creativity and analytical
          thinking. It encourages me to pay meticulous attention to small details, thereby
          improving my focus and skillfulness. At the same time, painting serves as a
          means to relieve stress, express emotions, and cultivate patience.
