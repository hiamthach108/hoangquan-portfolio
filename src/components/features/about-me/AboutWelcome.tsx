                Hello! My name is Pham Nguyen Hoang Quan. I was born on March 5, 2007, and
                I am currently a student at Luong The Vinh High School for the Gifted in
                Bien Hoa City, Dong Nai Province. With the motto &quot;Always strive, be
                persistent and believe in yourself,&quot; I consistently work hard to
                overcome challenges in life and achieve my ambitions. My future goal is to
                become a neurologist, assisting others in addressing mental health issues.

                I have a passion for creativity and often engage in activities such as
                playing the piano and violin, along with painting. These hobbies help me
                relax and unleash my imaginative side. I also have a special friend at
                homeâ€”a little cat. He is always by my side whenever I feel stressed,
                bringing me comfort and companionship.
