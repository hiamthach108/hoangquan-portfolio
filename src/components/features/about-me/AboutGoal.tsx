          My dream is to become a neurologist, mastering not only professional knowledge
          but also effective treatment methods for patients. I aspire to contribute to the
          advancement of Vietnamâ€™s medical field and support charitable initiatives,
          particularly in assisting children from disadvantaged areas with better
          opportunities for living and studying, enabling them to fulfill their dreams.
